                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Robot Uprising is Europe's largest hands-on robotics challenge where gaming, puzzles and storytelling are all combined. Robot Uprising has brought together over 500 techies and robotics enthusiasts to program, design and build robots to compete in our epic arenas. The Robot Uprising hackathon has been organized for three consecutive years in 2017 to 2019, after which we've focused on the Micro Invaders competition. We're currently rebooting our activities and planning future activities.</p>
                        <p>The story of Robot Uprising is set in 2042 and lore has an important role in our narrative. We offer an immersive alternative reality experience to our participants and partners.</p>
